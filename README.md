## NOAA Install

Below are the instructions for installing TagLab on AVD. Please read through this first, and then perform each action as instructed.

First, check that `Anaconda` is installed on your computer; do this by pressing the `Windows` key, and typing `Anaconda`. If the `Anaconda Prompt` is not present, consult with IT about installing 
[`miniconda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/).

Open `Anaconda Prompt` and check to see if a `taglab` environment already exists:
```python
# cmd
conda env list
```

If it doesn't, create a new conda environment called `taglab` where we will install all the dependencies.
```python
# cmd
conda create --name taglab python=3.8 -y
```

Once this has finished, or it already exists, get into or `activate` the conda environment by typing the following:
```python
# cmd
conda activate taglab
```

This should change your `cmd` from `(base)` to `(taglab)`; if it doesn't, do not proceed and consult with Jordan. Now we navigate to the `W:` drive, by typing in the following:
```python
# cmd
W:
```

This should change the drive you're in from `C:` to `W:`. From here, `change directories` to be inside the `TagLab` folder:
```python
# cmd
cd Code\TagLab\
```

If the folder doesn't exist, within the `Code` (or a common directory of your choosing), type:
```python
# cmd
git clone https://github.com/Jordan-Pierce/TagLab.git
cd TagLab
```

Now we will install the dependencies needed for `TagLab`:
```python
# cmd
python install.py
```

Once this has finished, you can run `TagLab`:
```python
# cmd
python TagLab.py
```

If you have issues installing, or getting `TagLab` to run, contact Jordan.

## Introduction

TagLab was created to support the activity of annotation and extraction of statistical data from ortho-maps of benthic communities. The tool includes different types of CNN-based segmentation networks specially trained for agnostic (relative only to contours) or semantic (also related to species) recognition of corals. TagLab is an ongoing project of the  [Visual Computing Lab](https://vcg.isti.cnr.it).

## Interaction
TagLab allows to :

- zoom and navigate a large map using (zoom/mouse wheel, pan/'Move' tool selected + left button). With every other tool selected the pan is activated with ctrl + left button
- segment coral instances in a semi-automatic way by indicating the corals' extremes with the 4-clicks tool. This is achieved using the Deep Extreme Cut network fine-tuned on coral images. Deep Extreme Cut original code can be found here: https://github.com/scaelles/DEXTR-PyTorch
- segment coral instances in a semi-automatic way by indicating the interior and the exterior of a coral using the positive-negative clicks tool. Use shift+left mouse button to assign the positive (the interior) points and shift+right mouse button to assign the negative (the exterior) points. This tool is based on the RITM interactive segmentation project, code and additional information can be found here: https://github.com/saic-vul/ritm_interactive_segmentation
- assign a class with the 'Assign class' tool or double-clicking the class in the labels panel
- Area, perimeter and other information are displayed in the region info panel on the right
- simultaneously turn off the visibility of one or more classes, (ctrl + left button/disable all but the selected, shift + left button, inverse operation), change the class transparency using the above slider
- perform boolean operations between existing labels (right button to open the menu)
- refine the incorrect borders automatically with the Refine operation or manually with the 'Edit Border' tool
- tracking coral changes in different time intervals
- import depth information of the seafloor
- import GeoTiff
- draw coral internal cracks with the 'Create Crack' tool
- make freehand measurements or measure the distance between centroids (Ruler tool).
- save the annotations (as polygons) and import them into a new project
- export a CSV file table containing the data of each coral colony
- export a JPG file of a black background with totally opaque labels
- export shapefiles
- export a new dataset and train your network (!)

We are working hard to create a web site with detailed instructions about TagLab. Stay tuned(!)


## Software Requirements


TagLab runs on __Linux__, __Windows__, and __MacOS__. To run TagLab, the main requirement is just __64bit Python 3.8.x, 3.9.x or 3.10.x__.

GPU accelerated computations are not supported on MacOS and on any machine that has not an NVIDIA graphics card.
To use them, you'll need to install the __NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit__, versions 10.2, 11.3, 11.6 and 11.7 are supported.
If you don't have a NVida graphics card (or if you use MacOS), CPU will be used.

## Installing TagLab

See the instructions on the [wiki](https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/TagLab/wiki/Install-TagLab).

## Updating TagLab

If you already installed TagLab and you need to update to a new version, you can just run the `update.py` script from the terminal (be sure to be into the TagLab main folder, see step 2):

```
python3 update.py
```
or, on Windows:

```
python.exe update.py
```

The script will automatically update TagLab to the newest version available in this repository.

NOTE: If some package is missing, after an update, re-launch install.py .

### Updating from 0.2

If you are updating TagLab from 0.2 version, in order to download also the new networks, please run the `update.py` script twice:

```
python3 update.py
python3 update.py
```
